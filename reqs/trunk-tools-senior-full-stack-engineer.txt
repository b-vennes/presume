At Trunk Tools, we’re the leading AI company revolutionizing construction—the second-largest industry on earth. We recently raised a $40M Series B led by Insight Partners, bringing our total funding to $70M from top-tier investors including Redpoint and Innovation Endeavors. This new round is fueling our next phase of growth as we scale AI agents across the jobsite.

Our mission is to build the future of construction through intelligent automation. Despite being a $13+ trillion industry, construction still runs largely on analog processes—we’re changing that by embedding AI directly into field operations.

Founded by builders and technologists (Stanford, MIT), our team has delivered software used by over 140,000 field professionals, impacting millions of users and contributing to $10B+ in built projects. Many of us come from the field ourselves, giving us a deep understanding of the industry’s unique challenges.

After years of building the “brain” of construction, we’re now launching production-ready AI agents—starting with intelligent document processing and Q&A, and rapidly expanding into core operational workflows. Our team has doubled in the past year, and with 65+ employees (25+ engineers), we’re scaling fast and entering a period of hypergrowth—this is a rare opportunity to join at an inflection point.
